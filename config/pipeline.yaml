# Avatar Pipeline Configuration

# This is a sample configuration file showing available options.
# The system auto-detects your hardware and applies appropriate defaults.
# Only specify values you want to override.

# Voice cloning and synthesis settings
voice:
  xtts:
    # Precision: fp16 or fp32 (fp16 recommended for VRAM efficiency)
    precision: fp16

    # Batch size for voice cloning (higher = faster but more VRAM)
    batch_size: 2

    # Temperature for voice synthesis (0.1-1.0, higher = more variation)
    temperature: 0.7

  tts:
    # Precision for TTS model
    precision: fp16

    # Vocoder quality: low, medium, high
    vocoder_quality: medium

# Avatar generation settings
avatar:
  sdxl:
    # Precision for SDXL model
    precision: fp16

    # Number of diffusion steps (more = better quality but slower)
    num_inference_steps: 40

    # Guidance scale (how closely to follow prompt)
    guidance_scale: 7.5

# Video and lip-sync settings
video:
  musetalk:
    # Precision for MuseTalk model
    precision: fp16
